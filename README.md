# SEPTIK: Stein-Enhanced Pathwise Inverse Kinematics

SEPTIK is a method for pathwise inverse kinematics (IK) that leverages JAX JIT compilation and vectorization, as well as stein-variational projection onto IK manifolds. The procedure will be similar to the multipartite graph structure of STAMPEDE[1], but will hopefully be able to outperform it in both runtime and accuracy.
